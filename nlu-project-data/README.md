## Aim 
- Assess the cumulative effect of social discourse tasks (hate speech, microaggressions, trolls and others) in an online environment

## Motivation
- A cumulative effect of different social problems such as hate speech, deception, condescension, trolls, politeness, and others in conversations have an overall intended effect on a personâ€™s psyche, rather than any individual problem. 
- The effect can have positive or negative consequences for a conversation participant or reader,  depending upon the interaction patterns observed among 
these tasks. For eg., polite conversations can conjure positive ideas, whereas conversations interspersed with hate and negative trolling can lead to
the development of misleading, and possibly, negative ideas. 
- Hence, this project is an attempt at deciphering the latent patterns among the social patterns, which in turn would help us in a better estimation of the overall effect.  

## Objective 
Analyse interactions between these tasks in a social media conversation, and aid in solving issues of social media collaboration and cancel culture
The system development can be accomplished as follows: 
- Extraction of Reddit conversational data to enable the study. 
- Discourse annotation for nodes and edges in the data and for each of the specific tasks. 
- Extraction of discriminative features from conversation utterances and on the basis of proven task-specific heuristics. 
- Conversion of text to knowledge graphs to enable learning of task(s)-based node and edge interactions with the help of Graph Attention Networks(GATs).

## Questions 
- Can we utilize network analysis to capture the existence of retrieved sub-problems? 
- Does one or more problems outweigh others, which might lead to an unbalanced dataset?
